**On Wednesday October 5,** our team presented at [http://1millioncups.com/wichita](1 Million Cups Wichita). As you may know, at every event the same question is posed to every presenter; "What can we as a community do to support you?"

**One of our answers was that the world needs more cool stuff,** and Wichita should make more great things than it's making now. To show how quickly that can happen, we took on a challenge of building a startup in a day. We took audience suggestions, validated the ideas with the people in the room, and set up our workstations right there at the event. You can find our updates throughout the day located here.

One of the ideas grew over the course an hour or two. We could plan an interesting date each month. We could work with the restaurants, venues, and entertainment options to discount the cost, and send a date through the mail. Delivery was simple. Almost every person we talked to liked the idea. So set out to build this site.

You can now sign yourself up, and for $50 per month we will send you a step-by-step plan for a great evening out and at least $50 in gift cards, vouchers, and entertainment delivered to your mail box.
