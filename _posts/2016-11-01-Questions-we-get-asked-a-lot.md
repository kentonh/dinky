There's been a lot of interest in what we're doing. And a lot of questions. Here are some of the most common Qs with As.

**How customized are these dates? Does everyone get the same date?**
All subscribers will receive the same set of instructions, information, and prepaid stuff. But even within that there are room for your own preferences.

**Are the packages for specific dates of the month? Do the vouchers expire? Is the package timely, or will I be able to use the date at any time in the future?**
The vouchers do not expire anytime soon. Some of the partners have a limited number of slots available. However, you always have at least three months to go on your date.

**"Basically, is this focused toward, say, a married couple like you who just wants to have an easy, brainless plan for time together, or for someone like me...?" - Alex Pemberton**
Well, Alex, the idea started with my wife, Lacy, and I. We just want to spend time together, and not make it routine. But, um, how do I put this, my wife's night out planning game is epic. So, even if you're taking someone new out each month, I truly believe you'll have a great time. You'll be able to forget about getting a table, and focus on the person/animal across the table.
