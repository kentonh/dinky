Wichita’s celebrating her 147th birthday this month! The best gift you can give our fair city is a little cash in her birthday card, so to speak. Did you know that when you spend $100 at a locally owned business, $68 of that money stays right here in the community? Only $43 stays remains locally when you spend that money at a national or non-local business.

That's why when we plan your date night, we work really hard to support our local business owners, creators, makers, musicians, chefs, and the like. They’re working hard every day to make Wichita the dynamic community we all know and love her to be, and create unique experiences for you and your love.
